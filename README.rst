Description
===========

Reads the LS_COLORS environment variable generated by GNU dircolors, converts
it to a format suitable for BSD's LSCOLORS variable, and prints the result to
stdout.

Motivation
==========

GNU ls supports colors with the ``--color`` option. The colors can be
customized by setting the LS_COLORS environment varible, typically set by
running GNU dircolors. (See GNU ``man ls``, ``man dircolors``, and ``man
dir_colors``.)

However, operating systems like macOS and FreeBSD do not use GNU ls; they use
BSD ls. On such systems, ls adds colors with the ``-G`` option which is
customized by the LSCOLORS variable. (See BSD ``man ls``.) More importantly,
the format of BSD LSCOLORS is incompatible with GNU LS_COLORS. So, if you have
added GNU LS_COLORS to your BSD-based environment, you currently have two
choices to take advantage of it:

1. Create and maintain the BSD LSCOLORS variable independently

2. Install GNU coreutils on BSD and alias GNU gls as ls

This program adds a third option:

3. Run gnu2bsd to us GNU LS_COLORS to generate BSD LSCOLORS

This allows you to keep using BSD ls while still storing your color
configuration in one place. Note, however, these two disadvantages:

#. BSD's ls colors are not as flexible as GNU's; many GNU options will be lost
   in the translation.

#. If you set LS_COLORS using GNU dircolors instead of setting it directly in
   the shell, you will still need to install GNU coreutils.

Installation
============

Copy this repository to a location of your choice. You can add ``gnu2bsd.py``
to your PATH or just run it with ``python /path/to/gnu2bsd.py``. Personally, I
keep this repository in ``~/.local/lib/`` with a symlink at
``~/.local/bin/gnu2bsd``.

Usage
=====

.. code:: bash

    # Ensure LS_COLOR is set
    eval "$(gdircolors)" # or ``eval "$(dircolors)`` or ``LS_COLORS=...``

    # Set LSCOLORS
    LSCOLORS=$(python /path/to/gnu2bsd.py)

You can now run BSD ``ls -G`` to get colors. You can additionally set the
CLICOLOR variable to get colors without needing the ``-G`` option:

.. code:: bash

    export CLICOLOR

Notes
=====

This program assumes that GNU dircolors set the LS_COLORS variable using ANSI
escape sequences. Because this is what dircolors does by default, and because
most terminals use ANSI, this program should work in most cases.
